# NGrams
Next Word Prediction based on ngrams: 
The goal of this project is to display that weâ€™ve gotten used to working with the data and that we are on track to create prediction algorithm. This project is about data understanding, data preparation, visualization and exploratory data analysis. Then build a predictive model to predict next word.
*Used R to develop codes, then used shinyapps.io to deploy the application.
